# CareCost - Health & Fintech Dashboard

CareCost is a React-based "Health Operating System" that correlates personal wellness data with financial health. It gamifies the experience of managing a health budget while tracking physical vitals.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** React (Vite), TypeScript
* **State Management:** React Context API + LocalStorage (Persistency)
* **UI/UX:** Material UI (MUI v6), Lucide React
* **Data Visualization:** Recharts (Dynamic pie & area charts)
* **Routing:** React Router DOM

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Financial Engine:** Dynamic budget tracking with "Solo" vs. "Family" plan switching.
* **Marketplace Logic:** Simulated e-commerce system where purchases deduct from the global health budget.
* **Health Analytics:** Daily logging system (Exercise, Nutrition, Mood) that calculates a gamified "Health Score."
* **Data Persistence:** Uses a custom hook to sync application state with browser LocalStorage, ensuring data survives refreshes.
